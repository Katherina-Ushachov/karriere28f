## Both a showcase and a creative project

# This is a mock website - or is it?

When we were giving the task to include as many different HTML, CSS and (later on) Javascript as possible and take a popular local jobsearch website as an example, the idea just came up to make a mock jobsearch website for one of the many worlds of my multiverse.
If you read the README-file where I introduce myself you'll know that I'm a writer and love to create worlds that are somewhat interconnected. One of those worlds is the one where the story of "Steel-Lily" or Stahllilie in German is set. I started creating it in 2018 or even prior, so I had a lot of material I could use and a very good grasp for "what could I make up to make this livelier?".
So I decided to use every morsel of knowledge that I gain to make this website better, serving two purposes:
* I get to apply my knowledge in a fun and goofy way that keeps me engaged and connects the knowledge to fun world building details, so I'll remember better.
* My readers get a website full of little whimsical tidbits and eastereggs they can discover.
* And last but not least, if they really can't find all of the eastereggs on their own, they can take a look at the source code.

#Will new content be added regularly?

Well, depends on how many new things I learn and how they can be integrated. As for now, e.g. most of the dropdown menu URLs lead nowhere on purpose and some of the sub-pages don't have much going on. Yet. Just follow this repository to keep up to date.

#I'm more into other genres, did you make websites for some of your other projects?

Not yet. Doesn't mean I'm not planning on installing some 'portals' to showcase some skills that might not be applicable to the mock career page. You'll see when they come up.
